# Geoscience Knowledge manager

This repository contains public work items related to development of the ontology and knowledge base for the Loop 3D geology project

**Loop3D-GSO** contains the ontology files and associated documentation
Files: 
 - **GSO_OFR_01Mar2021.docx**  Draft GSC Open File report describing the ontolgoy
 - **TimeIntervalRElation.pdf**  Diagram to help clarify Allen temporal relations between intervals and instants.
 - **GSO-Common.ttl**  OWL file with high level framework ontology
 - **GSO-Geology.ttl**  OWL file with framework for geoscience
 - **GSO-Master.ttl**  OWL file, ontology that imports all modules to assemble entire GSO ontology

sub directories:
**Modules**  Contains 28 module ontologies implementing aspects of geoscience building on framework in Common and Geology.
**Examples**  Contains a collection of instance documents (the .ttl files) demonstrating representation of various geologic scenarios.  This collection is likely to grow and change over time.
