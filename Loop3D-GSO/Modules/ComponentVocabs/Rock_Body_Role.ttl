  rdfs:comment "This file contains Rock Body Role vocabulary. Based on the CGI Geologic Unit Part role vocabulary, as defined by the IUGS Commission for Geoscience Information (CGI) Geoscience Terminology Working Group. Refactored to separate objects (Rock_Object.ttl) and roles more consistently.   A complex geologic unit like a migmatite complex or a lithologically heterogeneous stratigraphic unit will have many different lithologic components. The simplest approach to representing the lithologic heterogeneity is to report a single GeologicUnit element with Rock_Objects for each lithologic component; the role on these parts provides information about what kind of parts they are and perhaps something about their relationship, along with the kinds of rock they are composed of."@en ;

  a owl:Class ;
  rdfs:comment "Geologic unit part is one or more masses with generally sharp boundaries and block-like geometry within a matrix of some other material emplaced by processes at the earth's surface--e.g. volcanic eruption or mass wasting. Use for objects that are larger that what would be considered a clast, e.g. greater than about 10 m shortest dimension, typically large enough and sparse enough to be considered individual objects."@en ;
