In practice the use of clastic mudstone terminology as opposed to carbonate mudstone terminology may be dermined by a priori knowledge about the rock being categorized. If it is associated with other clastic rocks, the clastic categories will be favored, if with cabonate rocks, the carbonate categories will be favored. Carbonate rock subcatgories are defined on two orthogonal dimensions--mineralogy (calcitic vs. dolomitic vs non-carbonate impurities), and texture. The texture categories used here are those of Dunham (1962), and involve grain size (matrix vs. grains/allochems), fabric (matrix vs. grain supported), and genesis (bound, frame, or fragmental). The textural approach used for carbonate rocks is conceptually incompatible with that used for clastic sedimentary rocks, which is solely grain size or mineralogy based. This leads to problems in the vocabulary for rocks of mixed siliclastic/carbonate mineralogy (grainstone vs. sandstone, carbonate mudstone vs. carbonate rich mudstone, how to accomodate marlstone...)."@en ;

  rdfs:comment "Rock classified as Greenschist is difficult to categorize in the CGI SimpleLithology scheme. This stems in part from the variation in usage and the general fuzzy definition of the term. The definition of greenschist is generally something along the lines of 'metamorphosed rock with a greenish colour, characterized by the presence of actinolite, chlorite and epidote, and containing a planar or linear fabric. The presence or absence of schistose fabric in rocks called 'greenschist' is problematic. The fabric present in many rocks called greenschist is too weak or variably developed to meet the definition of 'schist' per CGI SimpleLithology. Generally if the rock has achieved metamorphic grade such that the term 'gneiss' is applicable, it would not be called greenschist. Thus, 'greenschist' would correspond most closely to a chlorite + actinolite rich 'Foliated metamorphic rock', but if it actually meets the definition of 'Schist' it would be a chlorite + actinolite 'Schist'."@en ;

The rock has a granoblastic texture and gneissose to massive structure; grain size and fabric may be variable on a decimetric scale. Foliation is less well developed than in rock that would typically be called gneiss. The minerals present in a granulite vary depending on the protolith and the temperature and pressure conditions experienced during metamorphism. According to Fettes and Desmons (2007) the main calc-silicate minerals are calcic garnet, calcic plagioclase, calcic scapolite, diopside-hedenbergite, epidote group minerals, hydrogrossular, johannsenite, prehnite, pumpellyite, titanite, vesuvianite, wollastonite.

  rdfs:comment "Robertson (1999, Classification of metamorphic rocks: British Geological Survey Research Report, RR 99–02) defines the boundary between diagenesis and metamorphism in sedimentary rocks as follows: “…the boundary between diagenesis and metamorphism is somewhat arbitrary and strongly dependent on the lithologies involved. For example changes take place in organic materials at lower temperatures than in rocks dominated by silicate minerals. In mudrocks, a white mica (illite) crystallinity value of less than 0.42 Delta 2 Theta obtained by X-ray diffraction analysis, is used to define the onset of metamorphism (Kisch, 1991). In this scheme, the first appearance of glaucophane, lawsonite, paragonite, prehnite, pumpellyite or stilpnomelane is taken to indicate the lower limit of metamorphism (Frey and Kisch, 1987; Bucher and Frey, 1994; Frey and Robinson, 1998). Most workers agree that such mineral growth starts at 150 +/- 50° C in silicate rocks. Many lithologies may show no change in mineralogy under these conditions and hence the recognition of the onset of metamorphism will vary with bulk composition.”"@en ;
